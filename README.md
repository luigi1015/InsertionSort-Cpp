InsertionSort-Cpp
=================

This small C++ project implements an in-place version of Insertion Sort.

To use the code you should include InsertionSort.cpp and call InsertionSort::insertionSort( std::vector<T> &items). The insertionSort function only takes 1 parameter, a vector of the items to be sorted.
